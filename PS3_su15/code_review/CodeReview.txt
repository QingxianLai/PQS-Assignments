### Stopwatch.java
1. class variable `id` is package-private. Since we should make our class as less accessive as possible, it should be specified as private and use public setter and getter method to manage it.

2. As recommended by Effective java, we should always override the toString() method which is missed here. Also

3. The `reset` method doesn't follow the requirement described in the IStopwatch interface. The interface says: will stop the watch if it is running, but in this method it throws an exception. And it initialize the startTime which is not necessary.


### StopwatchFactory.java
1. line 17 is too long
